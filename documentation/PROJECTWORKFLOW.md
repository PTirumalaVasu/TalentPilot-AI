# Detailed Session Description — Skills, Agents, and Files

## Agents Called

### Carson — Elite Brainstorming Specialist (`bmad-cis-agent-brainstorming-coach`)
**Purpose:** Acts as the persistent facilitation persona for the entire session — a 20-year veteran brainstorming coach archetype whose job is to make it psychologically safe to generate wild ideas, keep energy high, and apply "yes-and" improv logic rather than judging ideas prematurely.

**Why it was called:** The user explicitly invoked the `/bmad-cis-agent-brainstorming-coach` command to start the session in this persona rather than going directly into a raw skill.

**What it did specifically in this session:**
- Resolved its own customization (name, icon, communication style, principles, and its menu — a single option `BS` mapping to the `bmad-brainstorming` skill).
- Loaded the CIS module config (`_bmad/cis/config.yaml`) to know the user's name (TalentPilot), language (English), and output folder conventions.
- Greeted the user, presented the menu, and dispatched into `bmad-brainstorming` once the user described the Talent Pool problem.
- Remained "in character" (🧠 icon, enthusiastic tone, "yes-and" behavior) for the rest of the conversation, including inside the brainstorming skill itself, since the persona carries through sub-skill calls until dismissed.

No other agent was invoked in this session.

## Skills Used

### 1. bmad-brainstorming
**Purpose:** The core engine of the session — runs a structured, multi-phase ideation process: capture topic/goal → pick a facilitation stance and techniques → generate ideas through named creative techniques → converge the ideas into a decision → finalize with synthesis and artifacts.

**Why it was called:** Selected from Carson's menu once the user stated they wanted to brainstorm Talent Pool Management capabilities and identify MVP vs. roadmap features.

**Detailed purpose of each phase run inside this skill:**

- **Customization & setup phase** — resolved workflow-level settings (technique catalog location, output folder pattern) and checked for any existing in-progress session to resume (none found, so started fresh).
- **Topic/goal capture** — pinned down the exact scope (Talent Pool Management capabilities only, MVP vs. roadmap split) so every later technique stayed on-target instead of drifting into unrelated ideas.
- **Stance selection** — established **Creative Partner** mode, meaning the coach was allowed to contribute its own ideas alongside the user's, not just ask questions.
- **Technique selection** — the coach (not the user) chose which creative techniques to run, matched to a feature-discovery/planning goal:
  - **Job to Be Done** — used to uncover *why* HR and employees would actually use the system, before jumping to feature lists. This surfaced the core insight that employees want gaps closed fast, and HR wants instant proof of staffing readiness.
  - **SCAMPER Method** — used to systematically stress-test the "how progress gets captured" flow. The "Eliminate" and "Combine" lenses specifically drove the decision to remove all manual employee data entry and to split responsibility cleanly between HR (assigns must-do skills) and the AI assistant (finds content, tracks video progress).
  - **Morphological Analysis** — used to grid out combinations of roles, content types, and dashboard data fields, which produced the exact HR dashboard column list (name, skills, sub-skills, dates, status) and confirmed there are only two roles (HR, Employee).
  - **Cross-Pollination** — used to borrow proven UX patterns from unrelated industries; this is where the Netflix/Spotify "continue watching + resume" pattern was pulled in as a concrete employee-facing feature.
- **Convergence phase** — used the **MoSCoW** method specifically because the stated goal was scoping an MVP vs. a roadmap; sorted every surfaced idea into Must/Should/Won't buckets.
- **Finalize phase** — synthesized the session (the "three data flows" insight tying the no-manual-entry and narrow-AI-scope threads together), marked the session log complete, and handled artifact generation.

### 2. Report-generation instructions (ad hoc, not a separate skill)
The BMAD Invocation Report, session brief, and this detailed description were produced directly from the memlog and conversation record per your requests — these were not separate BMAD skills, just direct reporting on what the skills/agents above actually did.

## Files Created and Purpose of Each

All files live under:
`_bmad-output/brainstorming/brainstorm-talent-pool-management-capabilities-2026-07-07/`

### 1. `.memlog.md`
**Purpose:** The canonical, append-only memory of the entire session — every idea, decision, technique switch, and insight logged in time order, tagged by author (`user` or `coach`) since the session ran in Creative Partner mode.

**Why it exists:** It's the single source of truth the whole skill is built around — nothing is trusted from conversational memory alone; every phase (technique runs, convergence, finalize, and later the intent doc) reads from this file rather than re-deriving facts.

**Contents produced:** 24 entries — a technique-start marker for each of the four techniques, ~15 idea entries (mixed user/coach), 5 scope decisions (e.g., "no manual entry," "blocker column removed," "only two roles"), the MoSCoW convergence decision, and the final synthesis insight. Ends with `status: complete`.

### 2. `brainstorm-intent.md`
**Purpose:** A condensed, downstream-ready summary of only the *confirmed* decisions — MVP (Must) features, fast-follow (Should) features, and a brief "Won't (this time)" list — plus the core "three data flows" architectural framing. Written specifically so it can be dropped straight into `bmad-prd` or `bmad-product-brief` as clean input, without re-reading the whole session.

**Why it was created:** At wrap-up, the user was offered a choice of artifacts (HTML keepsake, intent doc, or other) and chose the intent doc. It was generated by a delegated subagent that read only `.memlog.md` (not the full conversation) to keep the generation isolated and prove the memlog was truly sufficient as the source of record.

No other files were created or modified during this session.

# Design Thinking Phase — Skills, Agents, and Files

## Agents Called

### Maya — Design Thinking Maestro (`bmad-cis-agent-design-thinking-coach`)
**Purpose:** The persistent facilitation persona for the full Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test → Next-Steps arc — an IDEO/Don Norman-style human-centered design coach whose job is to keep users at the center of every decision, defer judgment during ideation, and treat prototype/test failure as feedback rather than a problem.

**Why it was called:** The user explicitly invoked `/bmad-cis-agent-design-thinking-coach` to talk to Maya directly.

**What it did specifically in this session:**
- Resolved its own customization (icon 🎨, "jazz musician" communication style, principles — design is about THEM not us; validate through real interaction, not internal consensus; failure is feedback; design WITH users not FOR them).
- Loaded `project-context.md` as a persistent fact and the CIS module config for the user's name and language.
- Greeted the user, presented its single menu item (`DT` → `bmad-cis-design-thinking`), and dispatched once selected.
- Remained in character (🎨 prefix, improvisational tone) for the entire session, including through two party-mode digressions launched from inside the workflow's checkpoints.

**Ad hoc personas summoned via party-mode (not persistently invoked, but voiced in character across two rounds):**
- 📊 Mary (Analyst) — evidence/rigor voice; repeatedly flagged that no real user research existed beyond the brainstorm session.
- 📋 John (PM) — defended the Jobs-to-be-Done framing against a "this is just a migration" challenge.
- 🎨 Sally (UX Designer) — raised, then later revised, the dashboard-scanability/trust risk.
- 🏗️ Winston (Architect) — raised a still-unresolved video-hosting infrastructure constraint (self-hosted vs. third-party embeds).
- 💻 Amelia (Dev) — commented on build scope, defended the brainstorm's "Won't" list.
- 🧪 Murat (Test Architect) — pushed for a measurable success metric instead of a vague goal.
- ⚡ Victor (Innovation Strategist) — challenged whether the concept was genuinely disruptive or just table-stakes.
- 🔬 Dr. Quinn (Problem Solver) — surfaced a root-cause hypothesis (self-reporting, not the spreadsheet, is the real pain).
- 🧠 Carson (Brainstorming Specialist) — championed the "one signal, two wins" auto-capture/resume idea.

## Skills Used

### 1. bmad-cis-design-thinking
**Purpose:** Runs the full seven-step human-centered design workflow — (1) define the design challenge, (2) Empathize, (3) Define, (4) Ideate, (5) Prototype, (6) Test, (7) Plan next iteration — saving each step incrementally to one output artifact with a checkpoint after every step.

**Why it was called:** Selected from Maya's menu (`DT`) once the user confirmed they wanted the full process.

**Detailed purpose of each step run:**
- **Step 1 (Design Challenge):** Synthesized directly from the prior brainstorming session's `brainstorm-intent.md` after the user said "take all at once" rather than answering clarifying questions individually. Constraints (tech stack, timeline, budget) were explicitly flagged as undefined rather than invented.
- **Step 2 (Empathize):** Originally scoped as a live shadowing exercise, then pivoted when the user pointed back to `brainstorm-intent.md` as the source. Extracted only what the document actually supported (the dashboard column shape, the "chasing spreadsheets" pain phrase) and labeled the rest as open gaps instead of inventing texture. The user then filled three gaps directly — HR's primary action is assignment entry, employees self-report into the same shared sheet, and no workarounds exist — which became the confirmed core of the empathy map, with Says/Thinks/Feels rows explicitly marked "inferred."
- **Step 3 (Define):** Converted empathy findings into two POV statements (HR Admin, Employee) and six How-Might-We questions anchored on the discovery that data trust — not dashboard polish — was the real lever.
- **Step 4 (Ideate):** Selected three methods (Brainstorming, SCAMPER, Analogous Inspiration), generated 21 raw ideas, converged to 3 top concepts (Trust/Freshness Dashboard, Unified Auto-Capture + Resume Mechanic, Cheap Validation Sprint).
- **Step 5 (Prototype):** Selected four methods (Storyboarding, Paper Prototyping, Wizard of Oz, Role Playing) to make the top concepts tangible without writing code.
- **Step 6 (Test):** Built a full testing plan (who, tasks, questions, capture method), but deliberately left User Feedback and Key Learnings marked "not yet collected" rather than fabricating results, since no real sessions were run.
- **Step 7 (Plan Next Iteration):** Initially recommended a validation sprint (real HR interviews) as the top priority action. The user overrode this, so the artifact was revised to a build-first path instead, with real post-launch usage telemetry — not upfront interviews — as the validation mechanism, logged explicitly as a deliberate decision.

### 2. bmad-party-mode
**Purpose:** An interactive round-table skill that voices multiple installed BMAD agent personas at once, in character, to stress-test or enrich content through genuine disagreement rather than single-voice analysis.

**Why it was called:** The user selected the `[p]` Party-Mode option at the Step 1 and Step 2 checkpoints, offered by the design-thinking skill's standard checkpoint menu (`[a]` Advanced Elicitation / `[c]` Continue / `[p]` Party-Mode / `[y]` YOLO).

**What it did:**
- Resolved workflow customization and roster via `resolve_customization.py` and `resolve_party.py`. No `default_party` override was configured, so the full installed-agent roster (22 personas across the `bmm`, `cis`, `gds`, and `wds` modules) became the active room, run in `session` mode (one mind voicing every persona inline, no subagents spawned).
- **Round 1** (Step 1 checkpoint): stress-tested the design challenge statement — Victor challenged it as a mere "spreadsheet migration," John defended the Jobs-to-be-Done framing, Mary flagged the missing research, Sally raised the dashboard-scanability risk, Winston raised the undefined video-hosting constraint, Murat demanded a measurable success metric, and Carson championed the resume/continue-watching emotional wedge.
- **Round 2** (Step 2 checkpoint): reacted to the completed empathy map — Dr. Quinn proposed the root-cause hypothesis, Mary raised the "relief vs. resignation" interpretive ambiguity, Sally revised her earlier risk once she saw the self-reporting detail, Winston repeated his still-unanswered infrastructure question, and Murat proposed a concrete candidate success metric.
- Maintained a per-room, append-only memlog (`_bmad-output/party-mode/memories/installed/.memlog.md`) across both rounds — initialized on the first round, appended to on the second — so the room's key threads persist for any future party-mode session in this project, distilled rather than dumped raw on read.
- Both rounds ended with the user folding the room's findings back into the main Design Thinking artifact rather than continuing indefinitely or requesting the optional HTML keepsake.

## The Role of Project Context in This Workflow

**Purpose:** `_bmad-output/project-context.md` is the project's standing memory for AI agents — a single file every BMAD agent and skill in this project loads as a `persistent_fact` on activation (declared in each skill's `customize.toml` as `file:{project-root}/**/project-context.md`), so facts learned in one session are available to every future session without re-deriving them from scratch or re-reading the full conversation history.

**How it was used in this run specifically:**
- Loaded automatically at the very start, before Maya's greeting, as part of the agent's `persistent_facts` activation step — this is how Maya (and later, party-mode) already knew the project's git/branch conventions and BMAD output-folder conventions without being told.
- Its own embedded "Mandatory Rule" requires that any meaningful work update it as part of that work — this is why it was actively written to, not just read, during this session:
  - After the Design Thinking session's Step 7 checkpoint, a note was added to "BMAD process conventions" documenting where design-thinking session artifacts and party-mode memlogs live on disk, plus a Windows-specific note that the BMAD python helper scripts need the `python` launcher (not `python3`) and `PYTHONUTF8=1` for emoji output, since `uv` isn't installed in this environment — a fact discovered by trial and error this session that would otherwise cost the same debugging again next time.
  - After the user's final decision to skip the validation sprint, a new "Product & Design Decisions" section was added, recording *why* there's no HR interview data behind this design work, and flagging the root-cause hypothesis and the "tolerable vs. resigned" question as still-open assumptions rather than settled facts — specifically so a future agent (e.g., one running `bmad-quick-dev` or `bmad-prd` off this artifact) doesn't mistake inferred empathy-map content for validated research.
- In short: Project Context is what lets this project's *next* session — whether it's Maya again, John writing a PRD, or Amelia writing code — pick up exactly where this one left off, without the user having to re-explain any of it.

## Files Created or Modified

- **`_bmad-output/design-thinking-2026-07-07.md`** (created) — the full seven-step Design Thinking artifact: Design Challenge, Empathize (user insights, key observations, empathy map), Define (POV statements, HMW questions, key insights), Ideate (21 ideas, 3 top concepts), Prototype (methods, description, features to test), Test (plan; feedback/learnings honestly left pending), and Next Steps (refinements, action items, success metrics) — saved incrementally after every single checkpoint, not just at the end.
- **`_bmad-output/party-mode/memories/installed/.memlog.md`** (created, then appended to) — the default installed-agent party's persistent memory, holding both rounds' key beats (evidence gaps, concessions, ideas, still-open questions) so a future party-mode session in this project can pick the room's dynamic back up.
- **`_bmad-output/project-context.md`** (appended to, not overridden) — a BMAD-process-conventions note (where these new artifacts live, the Windows python/uv quirk) and a new "Product & Design Decisions" section (the deliberate no-validation-sprint decision and its carried assumptions).
- **`documentation/PROJECTWORKFLOW.md`** (this file, appended to) — this section.
